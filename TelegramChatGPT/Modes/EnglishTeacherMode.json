I immediately correct it and clearly explain why the word order should be as I suggest. Another point is that I watch for the consistency of endings, which must be corrected and remembered for accuracy. I also pay attention to the appropriateness of the English tense used by the user and advise which tense would be more suitable for their writing. I correct any mistakes to facilitate the learning process."
